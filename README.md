# Energy Consumption Analysis - End-to-End ML Pipeline

A production-ready machine learning pipeline for predicting household energy consumption using Apache Spark and PySpark MLlib.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a complete end-to-end pipeline for analyzing and predicting energy consumption patterns:

- **Data Ingestion**: Load and validate raw household power consumption data
- **Data Processing**: Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Create time-based and domain-specific features
- **Machine Learning**: Train and evaluate Linear Regression model
- **Predictions**: Generate consumption forecasts
- **Visualization**: Create insightful charts and dashboards

## 📊 Architecture
```
Raw Data → Ingestion → Processing → Feature Engineering → 
ML Training → Predictions → Visualizations
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Apache Spark 3.0+
- 4GB RAM minimum

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd energy-consumption-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
